# AIMMSlinks

''We encourage users to report bugs by creating an [issue](https://github.com/coin-or/AIMMSlinks/issues/new) and 
to ask questions using the [mailing list](http://list.coin-or.org/mailman/listinfo/AIMMSlinks) instead of contacting AIMMS Support.''

## Introduction

The AIMMSlinks project is dedicated to the development of links between the modeling language [AIMMS](http://www.aimms.com/) and solvers that are hosted at COIN-OR.
It is written in C++ and released as open source code under the [Eclipse Public License](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html) (EPL).
The links use the [AIMMS Open Solver Interface API](http://download.aimms.com/aimms/AimmsOSI/index.html).
The code has been written by Yidong Lang, Lorenz T. Biegler, Chuck Teeter and Marcel Hunting, who is the COIN-OR project leader for AIMMSlinks.

Currently the following links are available:

 * [Cbc](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc): LP and MIP solver
 * [Ipopt](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt): Interior Point Optimizer for large-scale nonlinear optimization

The Cbc and Ipopt links are available for Windows (32-bit and 64-bit) and Linux (64-bit only).

## Download and installation

You can download AIMMSlinks via git by typing 

```
git clone https://github.com/coin-or/AIMMSlinks.git
