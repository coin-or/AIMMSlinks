This release only supports building the solver interfaces to IPOPT on 32-bits and 64-bits Windows platforms,
and to CBC on 32-bits Windows platforms.

The instructions below assume that you are using the included Microsoft Developer Studio projects to build
the interfaced DLLs.

= Main installation steps =

 1. Install an AIMMS system.
 2. Build the AIMMS-IPOPT link.
 3. Build the AIMMS-CBC link.


= Detailed instructions =

== 1. Installation of an AIMMS system ==

While it is possible to build the solvers with AIMMS links without having an AIMMS system available, an AIMMS system
will be needed to use them. You need AIMMS version 3.10 of higher.

You can download AIMMS at http://www.aimms.com/downloads/aimms/download-aimms. You should have a valid AIMMS license
to be able to use AIMMS after installation. If you do not have a valid AIMMS license, you can request a one-time free
AIMMS Trial License or use a Free Student License.

The Trial License is a 30-day unrestricted trial license.

The Student License is limited in the number of identifiers (200) and the size of the optimization models (300x300),
allowing students to create and run small AIMMS models on their own computer.


== 2. Build the AIMMS-IPOPT link ==

For instructions for building libAimmsIpopt.dll, the AIMMS-IPOPT link, see the file INSTALL in the IpoptAimms directory.


== 3. Build the AIMMS-CBC link ==

For instructions for building libAimmsCbc.dll, the AIMMS-CBC link, see the file INSTALL in the CbcAimms directory.
