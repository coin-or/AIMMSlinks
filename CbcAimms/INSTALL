This release only supports building the solver interfaces to CBC on 32-bits Windows platforms.

The instructions below assume that you are using the included Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC) projects
to build the interfaced DLLs.

For installation of an AIMMS system, see the file INSTALL in the AIMMSlinks directory.

= Main steps to build the AIMMS-CBC link =

 1. Download and install CBC.
 2. Build the AIMMS-CBC dll.
 3. Add CBC to your AIMMS system.
 4. Test CBC in AIMMS.


= Detailed instructions =

== 1. Download and install CBC ==

Obtain the CBC source code via subversion inside the CbcAimms directory by using, e.g., 

   svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Cbc/stable/2.4 coin-Cbc

Alternatively one can obtain the source code from the directory,

   http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Cbc/

and downloading a file of the form Cbc-X.Y.Z.zip, e.g., Cbc-2.3.2.zip. Unzip this file to
a directory coin-Cbc inside the CbcAimms directory.

NOTE:
The MSVC v8 project file for CBC 2.3 contains some errors and therefore it is recommended to use
the MSVC v9 project file for CBC 2.3 or to use CBC 2.2 or 2.4.

(For installation instructions for CBC see also https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc.)

After obtaining the CBC source code the directory structure of the CbcAimms directory should be:

   - CbcAimms
     - coin-Cbc
       - BuildTools
       - Cbc
       - Cgl
       - Clp
       - CoinUtils
       - Data
       - doxydoc
       - Osi
       - ThirdParty
       - Vol
     - MSVisualStudio
       - v8
     - src

Open the solution file Cbc.sln in the CbcAimms\coin-Cbc\Cbc\MSVisualStudio\v8 directory using using Microsoft
Visual Studio Interactive Development Environment (IDE) version 8 or higher, and build the following CBC components:
cbcSolve, libCbc, libCgl, libClp, libCoinUtils, libOsi, libOsiClp. Note: if you build component cbcSolve then
automatically all other components are build.


== 2. Build the AIMMS-CBC dll ==

Build the code using Microsoft Visual Studio Interactive Development Environment (IDE) version 8 or higher by
opening the project file libAimmsCbc.vcproj inside the CbcAimms\MSVisualStudio\v8 directory.

The AIMMS-CBC dll built by default is for an AIMMS ASCII version. To build a dll for AIMMS Unicode, change
the value of 'Character Set' inside the project file (in Configuration Properties - General) into
'Use Unicode Character Set'.


== 3. Add CBC to AIMMS ==

Copy the libAimmsCbc.dll file to the Solvers directory of your AIMMS installation. After starting up AIMMS, add
CBC to the Solvers Configuration:
- Open the Solver Configuration dialog box (under Settings);
- Click Add;
- At the Solver DLL field, select the 'libAimmsCbc.dll' file using the File Selection dialog box;
- Click OK to accept the new solver.
- Set CBC as the default LP and MIP solver, and click OK to close the Solver Configuration dialog box.


== 4. Test CBC in AIMMS ==

After adding CBC to the solver configuration, you can test CBC by using some of the AIMMS examples.

- Example Farm Planning (LP):
  - Open the FarmPlanning.prj project.
  - Click Open Demo Page.
  - Open progress window by pressing CTRL+P.
  - Click Optimize. The progress window should contain the following information (amongst others):
  
     SOLVER            : CBC
       Best Solution   : 49949.98588
       Program Status  : Optimal
       Solver Status   : Normal completion

- Example Diet Problem (MIP):
  - Open the DietProblem.prj project.
  - Click Open Demo Page.
  - Open progress window by pressing CTRL+P.
  - Click Solve. The progress window should contain the following information (amongst others):
  
     SOLVER            : CBC
       Best Solution   : 24.6
       Program Status  : Optimal
       Solver Status   : Normal completion
